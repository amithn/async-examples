    Node.js is easy to get started with. You can get a HTTP server up and running in not time.
    Writing a JSON api is perfect for node which suppors JSON objects natively.
    
    I'm a newbie to node coming from a C,Java background. What i liked about node is easy to get 
    started. Javascript is a small language and i find it very similar to C. It has a great community around it 
    which is continously pushing the limits on performance. Amazing libraries available and npm (node package manager)
    for dependency management.

    When your webapp has to do more than trivial stuff, it gets a little tricky with node especially for developers 
    like me not used to the async programming model which node offers.

    This post explains a way to avoid deep nesting of function calls when working with node using the async module
